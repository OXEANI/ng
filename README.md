## How to start?

first run

Start simple by running `npm install` and then `npm run watch` (if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.
